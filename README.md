I have created a responsive layout builder where there is an initial partition with a random color and two buttons named 'V' and 'H'. Clicking the 'V' button will split the initial partition vertically, and clicking the 'H' button will split it horizontally. After the split, one of the partitions will retain its old color, and the new partition will have a new random color.
The new partitions created via splitting should also be further splittable, and if there are multiple partitions, any partition can be removed via a '-' button. 
The partitions should be resizable by clicking and dragging.
Optionally, the partitions could snap to 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 ratios.
Implement the following functionality:
1. Start the challenge
2. Display an initial partition with 'V' and 'H' buttons
3. Successfully split the initial screen
4. Successfully split each partition further
5. Be able to remove any partition
6. Be able to resize the partitions

Also, I have developed a React application that displays a grid of tiles, each representing a letter of the alphabet in uppercase format. I implemented the following functionality:
1. Tile Rendering: Render a tile for each letter of the alphabet (A to Z) within a container or grid layout.
2. Click Interaction: When a tile is clicked, append the corresponding letter to a string displayed in an HTML element with the ID outputString.
3. Consecutive Letter Replacement: If three consecutive letters in the outputString are the same, replace them with an underscore (_). For example, if the user clicks "A", "B", "C", "F", "F", "F", "G" in that order, the outputString should display "ABC_G". 4. Multiple Consecutive Letters: If more than three consecutive letters are the same, replace them with the appropriate number of underscores. For instance, if the user clicks "A" six times followed by "B", the outputString should display "_B".
5. Validation: Your solution will be validated by our system, so make sure it meets the specified requirements.

Example Output:
Initial state: outputString is empty.
• After clicking "A", "B", "C", "F", "F", "F", "G": outputString displays "ABC_G".
• After clicking "A" six times followed by "B": outputString displays "__B".
